# Spelling Game
This is an audio-based spelling game that prompts the user to spell words, of increasing difficulty. It also calculates the percentage of how correct a misspelt word is.<br></br>
To run the program:<br>
1. Download the "SpellGame" folder;<br>
2. install the required dependencies listed at the beginning of the program. I.e., pywin32 and tkinter;<br>
3. Run the program via powershell otherwise an error regarding adding pywin32 to PATH might show up. I.e., type "python .\SpellGame\Spell.py"<br></br>

Unfortunately, you can't repeat the game. So if you want to play around with it multiple times, you need to close the tkinter window and run the program again.<br>
If Spell.py doesn't work, you might need to create a virtual environment and install the dependencies listed at the start of the program or add pywin32 to PATH.
